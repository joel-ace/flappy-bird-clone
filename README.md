# Bird Game clone with Basic 2D Game Engine Simulation

This project is a simple implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in TypeScript. Additionally, it includes a laughable attempt at creating the most basic simulation of a 2D game engine for endless runner 2D games on the browser.

It's important to note that I have never developed a game before, neither have I used a game engine. I did not conduct any research on creating a game engine or engage in any form of design before coding. All decisions were made on the go. 

My approach to creating this game can only be described as an overkill as there are much easier and faster ways to get this done. This project is a result of experimentation and learning, and any shortcomings or unconventional approaches are part of the learning process. Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, or use it as a starting point for your own learning journey.

## Features
2D Flappy Bird like game with a simple and intuitive control scheme.
Basic 2D game engine simulation for endless runner games.
Object-oriented design to encapsulate game and game engine entities and behaviors.

## How to Play
still working on game. Will update when I'm done

## Usage Disclaimer
This project is not intended for use to develop any products and should be used for learning alone. It does not adhere to best practices, and the game engine simulation is rudimentary at best. For serious game development, it is recommended to explore established game engines and follow proper design and development processes.
